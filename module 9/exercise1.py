Implement an Insertion sort function
Given the information you have received in the course about the Insertion sort algorithm, implement a function that uses it. The function needs only to accept the array to be sorted as parameter. The function returns nothing. The array is sorted in-place.

Given an array like: [6, 8, 5, 1, 2], the sorted array would be: [1, 2, 5, 6, 8]

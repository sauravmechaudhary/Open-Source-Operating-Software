"""
Implement a heapsort function
Given the information you have received in the course about the heapsort algorithm, implement a sort function that uses it. The function needs only to accept the array to be sorted as parameter. Use the sift_down helper function to complete the task (it is available even if it is not visible)

Given an array like: [6, 8, 5, 1, 2], the sorted array would be: [1, 2, 5, 6, 8]
